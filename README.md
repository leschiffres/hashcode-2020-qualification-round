# Google Hashcode 2020 - Qualification Round

This is a repo containing our solution for the qualification round of google hashcode 2020.

To run the algorithm run in terminal: `python3 run.py`

## Brief Description

Given a list of libraries and the books they contain, choose which libraries should scan which books while maximizing the total score of books, while keeping in mind that a library has a signup time cost.

## Implemented Algorithms

We implememted a simple heuristic where we sort the libraries by a score that expresses the importance of the books a library contains over it's speed to deliver value.
